# CYB333 Midterm Project – Security Automation with Python

## 🔐 Project Overview
This midterm project demonstrates foundational security automation using Python. It includes a TCP client-server communication system and a multithreaded port scanner. The scripts are designed to showcase basic socket programming, input validation, error handling, and ethical scanning practices.

## 📁 Repository Contents

- `client.py` – A TCP client that connects to a server, sends user input, and displays the server's response.
- `server.py` – A TCP server that listens for incoming connections and echoes back received messages.
- `port_scanner.py` – A multithreaded port scanner that checks for open/closed ports on a target host.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Alycia614/cyb333-midterm.git
   cd cyb333-midterm
